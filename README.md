# Skill Set Challenge!
[Hudson & Thames](https://hudsonthames.org/) has provided the following skillset challenge to allow potential researchers to gauge if they have the required skills to take part in the apprenticeship program. 

## Your Mission:
The following assignment is an opportunity for you to highlight your skillset and show us what you are made of! It tests your ability to implement academic research for the broader quantitative finance community, and to do it in style!

### Briefing
Read the following [paper](http://premio-vidigal.inesc.pt/pdf/SimaoSarmentoMSc-resumo.pdf).

In a Jupyter Notebook (python):

1. Download and save your universe of stocks (use 500-700 shares) (Can use Yahoo finance to get shares data. Checkout the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) package.)
1. Implement Section III: Proposed Pairs Selection Framework (A and B, Section C if you really want to impress)
1. Create a set of functions/class for the end-user to make use of.
1. Make sure to add docstrings and follow PEP8 code style checks. Have plenty of inline comments, good variable names and don't over complicate things unnecessarily. It should be easy for the user to make use of.
1. Showcase your new Pairs Selection Framework in a Jupyter Notebook and show us some visualizations of the clusters and pairs.
1. Add an introduction, body, and conclusion showcasing your new implementation. (Use the correct style headers)
1. Make a Pull Request to this repo so that we can evaluate your work. (Create a new folder with your name)
1. Bonus points if you add unit tests (in a separate .py file).

### Notes
* Your code for the implementation should be contained in a .py file that you import into your notebook. Please don't have large chunks of code in your notebook.
* Your function must take in a pandas DataFrame, not a file directory.
